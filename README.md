Intelligent Customer Help Desk with Smart Document Understanding

Summary

A chatbot is a software application that is used to conduct an on-line chat conversation which simulates a human-like interaction. A chatbot is often described as one of the most advanced and promising expressions of interaction between humans and machines. A typical customer care chatbot can answer simple questions, such as store locations and hours, directions, etc. When a question falls outside of the scope of the pre-determined question set, the option is typically to tell the customer the question isn’t valid or offer to speak to a real person.
 
In this project, there will be another option. If the customer question is about the operation of a device, the application shall pass the question onto Watson Discovery Service, which has been pre-loaded with the device’s owner's manual. So now, instead of offering the customer to speak to a representative, we return relevant sections of the owner's manual to help solve the customers’ problems. The project uses Smart Document Understanding feature of Watson Discovery to train it on what text in the owner's manual is important and what is not. This will improve the answers returned from the queries.
